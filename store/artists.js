      biography: `
          <p>A Stadium Jakarta headline show. Multiple tours across Asia. Tomorrowland. Djakarta Warehouse Project. The USA. Releases on ToolRoom Records sister label Zerothree. Monaberry. Truesounds Music. Awen Records. Not bad for someone working a regular 9 to 5 job just months before this all happened. Someone in a previously mundane existence with a simple dream: to win a DJ contest and escape the humdrum.</p>
          <p>So she gave it a shot.</p>
          <p>Mari Furuya won the DJ contest. She played Tomorrowland. She escaped the humdrum. She toured the world. She scored releases on some of the biggest institutes for house music. Apsara found her calling overnight and became one of the most exciting and narratively gifted house DJ's Asia has seen in a long time.</p>
          <p>After being introduced to acts like the Chemical Brothers and Underworld at a very young age, her infatuation with music blossomed into a virus when she went to her first ever rave in San Francisco where she moved from Japan to study. Not bound to any particular subgenre, her seamless blend of trance, techno and progressive house has lit up dance floors across the world and her ever evolving productions always follow the trend in riveting melodic fashion.</p>
          <p>Having achieved significant global successes already, Apsara isn't resting on her laurels. She's plotting world tours, her own events brand, international residencies and many more releases full of pulsating basslines and ever evolving melodies.</p>
          <p>Two stars are now rising in the east and they will both light up your world. But only Apsara will do it permanently. Wait and see.</p>
